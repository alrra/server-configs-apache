# Force client-side SSL redirection.
#
# If a user types `example.com` in their browser, even if the server
# redirects them to the secure version of the website, that still leaves
# a window of opportunity (the initial HTTP connection) for an attacker
# to downgrade or redirect the request.
#
# The following header ensures that browser will ONLY connect to your
# server via HTTPS, regardless of what the users type in the browser's
# address bar.
#
# (!) Remove the `includeSubDomains` optional directive if the website's
# subdomains are not using HTTPS.

# Cache SSL redirection
#
# Using this header, any browser that accesses the site over HTTPS will not
# be able to access the plain HTTP site for one day (86400 seconds).
# One you begin using this, you should not stop using SSL on your site or
# else your returning visitors will not be able to access your site at all.
#
# (!) Remove the `env=HTTPS` optional directive if you want to force
# HTTP to HTTPS.
